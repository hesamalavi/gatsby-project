      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I am fascinated by computer science and programming. Can’t get enough of
        it. I’m an aspiring frontend developer. Would love to work with a team
        of tech-passionate people whom I could learn from. Can’t wait for that
        day to come. Currently I am enthusiastically learning programming and
        web development (Javascript, React, HTML, CSS, CSS Grid, SASS) so I
        could get into programming full-time. Computer science fundamentals
        excite me to the point that I find it hard to fall sleep if I am
        learning concepts close to bed time. I work 3 days a week and learn the
        rest of the time. I love programming as you get to build things and of
        course break them :). I find programming like meditating with the eyes
        open as I go in a zone and feel present while doing so. I am learning
        how to take breaks in between, otherwise I find myself staring at the
        screen for more than 8 hours straight. Coming from neuroscience
        background with a focus on learning, I am aware that learning happens
        when we rest well ;) I am a results-driven professional with over 7
        years of experience as a business development and sales manager in B2B,
        B2C and retail. Hands-on experience working in fast-paced environments
        with changing priorities, and designing and implementing data-driven
        sales strategies. Consistently delivered profitable solutions to drive
        sales, attract and retain customers and build a solid relationship with
        stakeholders. Experience in training and managing staff. Stellar
        organisational and planning skills as demonstrated in successfully
        launching two startups. I love connecting with people from all walks of
        life, and I see all as my teacher as we all have a unique point of view.
        I have lived and studied in 5 different countries and am very fund of
        different cultures. I love the outdoors and getting reconnecting with
        nature. I also like learning new things and believe that life without
        growth comes to an end too.
